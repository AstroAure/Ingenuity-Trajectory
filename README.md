# Ingenuity-Trajectory
Theses codes are all the steps involved in the calculation of the trajectory of Ingenuity using the pictures it took during its flights


1-Ingenuity spotted : Finds Ingenuity, given a template, on every picture during a flight

2-Target generation : Generates intersteing targets on the ground

3-Feature matching : Matches these generated targets between two pictures to find relative terrain motion

4-Movement acquisition : Calculates Ingenuity's movement relative to the ground between two pictures

5-Trajectory drawing : Draws the full trajectory of the flight

6-Trajectory on HiRISE : Draws the full trajectory on a given background map made by HiRISE

7-HiRISE+NavCam : Creates a GIF of the flight with NavCam pictures and live orbital follow on the HiRISE map


WIP : I'll add comments and description to make it easier to understand and to use.
